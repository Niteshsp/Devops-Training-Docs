Install Python latest version (on Control node and Managed host)

yum install python3 -y
By default, python3 is the command to run python commands. to use just python, use "alternatives" command. (on Control node and Managed host)

alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3
Check for Python version

python --version
Install python-pip package manager (on Control node)

yum -y install python3-pip
Create a new user for ansible administration & grant admin access to the user (on Control node and Managed host)

useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin
Below command adds ansadmin to sudoers file. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. (on Control node and Managed host)

echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
Using key-based authentication is advised. If you are still at the learning stage use password-based authentication (on Control node and Managed host)

# sed command replaces "PasswordAuthentication no to yes" without editing file 
 sed -ie 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 sudo service sshd reload
Install Ansible as a ansadmin user (on Control node)
su - ansadmin
pip3 install ansible --user
Note: Ansible must be installed as a user (here ansadmin)

check for ansible version

 pip3 install ansible --user
    2  ansible --version
    3  ssh-keygen
    4  ls
    5  ssh-copy-id ansadmin@172.31.43.14
    6  cd /etc/ansible
    7  mkdir /etc/ansible
    8  sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
    9  suod vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   10  sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   11  cd .ssh
   12  ls
   13   sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   14  ansible all -m ping
   15  cd
   16  ansible all -m ping
   17  vi ansible.cfg
   18  vi /etc/ansible
   19  ls
   20  pwd
   21  ls
   22  find ansible.cfg
   23  sudo ansible.cfg
   24  cat /etc/ansible/hosts
   25  vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   26  sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   27  ansible all -m ping
   28  clear
   29  pwd
   30  sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   31  ansible all -m ping
   32  sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
   33  ansible --version
   34  ls
   35  ls -la


ansible --version
Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)

ssh-keygen
Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)

ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
Validation test
Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node IP address in it.

Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)

ansible all -m ping
